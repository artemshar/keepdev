The IT industry has a huge amount of terminology. In this document, I will collect terminology that is found and used not only by programmers, but also by people at the management level (a separate post will be created for engineers and programmers).

Although many new words and expressions are coming from the world of technology to the world of business, there will also be some that relate only to business, such as Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).

It is important for us, as developers and programmers, to be able to speak the same language with all representatives of the IT industry: company founders, marketers, management, or representatives of other industries in which the same words may be understood differently. Therefore, there may be many intersections and references to other dictionaries.

This post will be updated from time to time as I come across something new that I think is important to add here.

By the way, please note that this is just terminology. That is, in this post I am not trying to agree with you on how it is correct (although, of course, you need to strive for accuracy), I am rather trying to figure out how a certain word or phrase is most likely understood in the IT industry and what we may have options for understanding.
