# What is ADR?

In software development, there is a best practice for documenting architectural decisions in a structured and defined way: an Architecture Decision Record or short ADR.

## Template

#### Title
Give a meaningful name that quickly lets the reader understand what this ADR is all about.

#### Status
Note the status of this ADR. This depends on the individual process of your team or company. Usually, this section only holds a single word defining the status.

Examples are: proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded

#### Context
This section explains the context, problem, or issue that causes the need for this decision. Some also call this section “motivation.”

Be precise and focus on facts.

#### Decision
Describe the proposed change. Stick to the facts and don’t try to sell the decision. Also, describe how and why you came to this decision. Point out alternatives that were looked at during the decision-finding process.

#### Consequences
Describes the effects of the change. What becomes easier? What will be more difficult?
